    <h1>IRIS_Flower Classificaiton : </h1>
    <p>Its a Task given me during my remote internship at infoAid Tech So Basically in this I Used <b><i>Descision Tree
                Classifier </i></b> for the Iris Dataset , But first I clean it Like Preprocess it and then Train the model.  </p>
    <p>its <b>Accuracy</b> : 100% or 1.0  you can check it in the code . </p>
    <p>I also create an interface usiing the Python Library Known as  <b><i>Gradio</i></b> which is really helpful in deploying the models and chatbots. etc.</p>
    <p>Here is the Link og Python Library Gradio : <a href="https://www.gradio.app/">gradio</a> you can explore from it from here ! </p>
